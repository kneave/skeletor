A skeletal biometric system using the Microsoft Kinect v2 sensor, developed at the Satellite Applications Catapult Disaster Response hackathon.

This was developed to enable identity based interaction with our videowalls, it was integetrated into our Illegal Fishing demonstrator such that when an enrolled user stands in front of the screen it automatically zooms to their area of interest.
